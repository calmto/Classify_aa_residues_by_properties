# Classify_aa_residues_by_properties
A Python3 script from our study on protein-drug interactions. We analyze single-point mutations in a protein's drug-binding segments, categorizing mutations by amino acid properties ('Aromatic', 'Aliphatic', 'Positive', etc.). The resistance profiles are visualized in a heatmap using matplotlib, aiding in understanding drugs sensitivity mechanisms.
